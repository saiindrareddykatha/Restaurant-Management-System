# Restaurant-Management-System

The main aim of the project is to provide an easy way to customers if they want to order food 
and reserve a table. The customers can also order their favorite food while reserving a table. 
The customers can also order food from their home easily. The restaurants will also provide 
home delivery for ordering food online. So, it can be very easy for customers to interact and 
order food through the respective restaurant. The system allows restaurant owners to manage 
their business more efficiently by providing a range of features such as menu management, 
table reservations, order management, kitchen management, and billing.
